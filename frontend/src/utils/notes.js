// Personal development notes - jotted down some ideas here while coding

// TODO: Maybe add more filter options later?
// - Filter by store category
// - Distance-based filtering
// - Price range filter

// BUGS I FIXED:
// - Rating bars weren't showing proportionally (fixed by calculating percentages on frontend)
// - Admin dashboard kept rerendering (fixed useEffect dependencies)
// - Button labels were invisible (wrong Tailwind classes)

// FEATURES THAT TOOK FOREVER:
// 1. NeonDB connection - kept getting timeout errors at first
// 2. Authentication middleware - had to debug token verification
// 3. Rating aggregation - SQL queries were tricky
// 4. Pagination - math was confusing me initially

// RANDOM THOUGHTS:
// - Should probably add loading spinners to more components
// - Error handling could be better in some places
// - Maybe add a dark mode toggle someday?
// - The gradient background looks pretty good though!

// COFFEE BREAK FIXES:
// - Fixed the star rendering after my third cup
// - Got the search working properly after lunch
// - Pagination finally clicked after a walk

// console.log('If you see this, I forgot to remove a debug line!'); // oops
